										<h2>Technology and Information Systems</h2>
					
									</header>
									<p>Technology and Information Systems explores how technology manages, processes, 
                                        and utilizes information in organizations and daily life. Students learn about hardware, 
                                        software, networks, and data, and how these elements support decision-making and operations. 
                                        The course covers data management, cybersecurity, systems development, and emerging 
                                        technologies like AI and cloud computing, while also addressing ethical considerations. 
                                        It highlights the role of information systems in solving real-world problems and driving 
                                        innovation in a digital world.</p>

												<h4>Design Thinking: MBTI-Personalized Playlist and Quotes</h4>
												<p>This project uses Design Thinking principles to craft a personalized experience based on the MBTI 
                                                    (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) personality framework. By understanding each user's personality type, 
                                                    the platform curates playlists and motivational quotes that resonate with their unique traits and preferences. 
                                                    The goal is to provide users with a more tailored and meaningful experience, whether they are looking for 
                                                    the right music to match their mood or seeking inspiration that aligns with their personality. Through this 
                                                    personalized approach, the project aims to enhance well-being, motivation, and overall user satisfaction.</p>
                                                <p>Reflection: This project was carried out as a group collaboration involving four people. Methods of collaboration 
                                                    and brainstorming in a group were explored and applied. A deeper understanding of designing an app from scratch
                                                     was gained through this process.
