                        <p>This course serves as a foundation for students, introducing them to problem-solving techniques through 
                            a structured approach. Throughout the course, students will learn to develop programs using C++ 
                            to tackle a range of problems, from simple to moderately complex. Key topics include preprocessor 
                            directives, constants and variables, data types, input/output operations, and control structures 
                            like sequencing, selection, and loops. Students will also explore built-in and user-defined functions, 
                            single and two-dimensional arrays, file handling, pointers, and structured data types, giving them the 
                            practical skills needed to approach real-world programming challenges.</p>
